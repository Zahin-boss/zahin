		<h1>Cumilla Cantonment Lake Side</h1>
		<p>During the Second World War, a jungle warfare school was set up at Comilla by the 14th Indian Infantry Division.[1] after the mid-1942 Allied retreat from Burma. The school emphasized techniques in six areas key to successful fighting in jungle terrain: outflanking, being outflanked, ambushing and other minor tactics, the myth of the impenetrable jungle, health, and fitness.[2] The school was transferred to Sevoke in 1943.[3]

In 1943-1944, military contractors constructing what was then called Mainamati Cantonment disturbed and damaged unsurveyed archaeological remains at the site.[4] Later, the base was renamed Comilla Cantonment.[5]</p>
